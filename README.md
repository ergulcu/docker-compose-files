# Docker Compose Examples

This guide provides a set of ready-to-run Docker Compose commands for managing your containers. Below are some common scenarios and their corresponding commands.

## Basic Commands

### Start the Services
To start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Stop and Then Start the Services
To stop the containers and restart them with recreated images:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

### Stop and Then Start with Recreated Images
If you want to stop the services, recreate the images, and then start the services, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

### Stop with Removing Volumes and Then Start
To stop the services, remove associated volumes, and then start the services, use:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up
```

### Stop with Removing Volumes and Then Start with Recreated Images
To stop the services, remove associated volumes, recreate the images, and then start the services, run:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

### Additional Notes
Ensure you are in the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file when running these commands.

The --force-recreate flag ensures that containers are recreated even if their configuration or image hasn't changed.

The -v flag in docker-compose down removes any volumes associated with the services.

For more information, refer to the Docker Compose documentation.
